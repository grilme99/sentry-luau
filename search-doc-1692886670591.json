It receives the event object as a parameter, so you can use that to modify the event’s data or drop it completely (by returning nil) based on custom logic and the data available on the event. In Lua, you can use a function to modify the event or return a completely new one. You can either return nil or an event payload. If you return nil, the event will be discarded. Sentry.init({ dsn = &quot;__DSN__&quot;, -- Called for message and error events beforeSend = function(event) -- Modify or drop the event here if event.user then -- Don't send user's email address event.user.email = nil end return event end, })  Note also that breadcrumbs can be filtered, as discussed in theBreadcrumbs documentation. Event Hints​ The beforeSend callback is passed both the event and a second argument, hint, that holds one or more hints. Typically a hint holds the original exception so that additional data can be extracted or grouping is affected. In this example, the fingerprint is forced to a common value if an exception of a certain type has been caught: Sentry.init({ -- ... beforeSend = function(event, hint) local error = hint.originalException local message = error and error.message if string.match(message, &quot;database unavailable&quot;) then event.fingerprint = { &quot;database-unavailable&quot; } end return event end, })  For information about which hints are available see hints in Lua. When the SDK creates an event or breadcrumb for transmission, that transmission is typically created from some sort of source object. For instance, an error event is typically created from a log record or exception instance. For better customization, SDKs send these objects to certain callbacks (beforeSend, beforeBreadcrumb or the event processor system in the SDK).

Imagine your application as a vast network of interconnected parts. For example, your system might be spread across different servers or your application might split into different backend and frontend services, each potentially having their own technology stack. When an error or performance issue occurs, it can be challenging to pinpoint the root cause due to the complexity of such a system. Distributed tracing helps you follow the path of an event as it travels through this intricate web, recording every step it takes. By examining these traces, you can reconstruct the sequence of events leading up to the event of interest, identify the specific components involved, and understand their interactions. This detailed visibility enables you to diagnose and resolve issues more effectively, ultimately improving the reliability and performance of your distributed system.
