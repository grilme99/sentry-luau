-- note: In order to avoid circular dependencies, if you add a function to this module and it needs to print something,
-- you must either a) use `console.log` rather than the logger, or b) put your function elsewhere.

-- note: This module is called `worldwide` in upstream to avoid bundler issues. That isn't a concern with Lua, so we've
-- gone back to the original name (`global`) for explicitness.

-- deviation: Luau has no `keyof` operator for types, so we'll manually type the keys of __SENTRY__ global

-- deviation: Lua only has one global object we care about, so we don't need to check different sources like with
-- upstream.
