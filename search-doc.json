Some SDKs will try to automatically configure a release out of the box, but it's a better idea to manually set it to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source inthe releases documentationor the sandbox.
